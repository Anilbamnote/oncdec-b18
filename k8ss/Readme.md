Orchestration Tool: Kubernetes


Introduction to Kubernetes

Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Initially developed by Google, Kubernetes is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). It has become the industry standard for container orchestration.

Why Do We Need an Orchestration Tool?

With the rise of containerized applications, managing containers in production environments has become increasingly complex.

Challenges include:

1.Scalability: Managing hundreds or thousands of containers.


2.Load Balancing: Ensuring even distribution of traffic across containers.

3.High Availability: Preventing downtime by managing container failures automatically.

4.Resource Optimization: Efficiently utilizing system resources like CPU and memory.

5.Service Discovery: Making it easy for containers to communicate with each other.

6.Automation: Reducing manual intervention for repetitive tasks like deployment and scaling.

Container orchestration tools like Kubernetes address these challenges by automating the deployment, scaling, and operation of containers, making them essential in modern DevOps workflows.
